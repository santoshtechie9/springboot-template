### **What is a Design Pattern?**  
A **design pattern** is a repeatable solution to a common problem in a specific context. It’s a proven template or blueprint that helps structure and solve recurring design challenges, promoting best practices, maintainability, and scalability.  

Now, let’s look at the differences between software, cloud, and guidance design patterns:  

| **Aspect**                     | **Software Design Patterns**                                         | **Application Design Patterns**                                       | **Cloud Design Patterns**                                              | **Guidance Design Patterns**                                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                       | Solving code-level design problems (e.g., object interactions).        | Structuring application components and workflows.                     | Addressing architecture and infrastructure concerns in cloud systems.  | Offering strategic or procedural advice for decision-making.       |
| **Scope**                       | Application-level (e.g., modules, classes, methods).                   | High-level application design (e.g., services, layers, UX flows).     | System-level (e.g., distributed systems, scalability, fault tolerance). | Broader guidance across design, implementation, and operations.    |
| **Examples**                    | Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy.                               | MVC (Model-View-Controller), CQRS, Microservices, Saga.               | Circuit Breaker, Event Sourcing, Strangler Fig.                         | Security best practices, deployment strategies, governance models. |
| **Implementation**              | Typically implemented directly in code.                               | Defines application logic and flow.                                   | Implemented via cloud services and infrastructure.                     | Applied as high-level architectural choices or policy frameworks.  |
| **Goal**                        | Improve code reusability, readability, and maintainability.            | Ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability of applications.  | Enhance resilience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in the cloud.  | Help teams make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls.      |

### **Quick Example:**  
- **Software Design Pattern:** The **Observer** pattern notifies dependent objects of state changes.  
- **Application Design Pattern:** The **CQRS** pattern separates read and write operations for scalability.  
- **Cloud Design Pattern:** The **Queue-Based Load Leveling** pattern buffers requests to prevent overload.  
- **Guidance Design Pattern:** **Zero Trust Security** enforces strict access controls across all layers.
